    <p contenteditable="true">How are you Telle? I know it's only been days, and I contemplated a lot, and I've realized that I really don't want to part ways with you. Im deeply sorry for what I've done, as in like everything. And, you were right, my messages were really off, I couldn't help but laugh and, at the same time feel disgusted by the things I said. I've reflected and realized that I was too complacent about what we have, and that's why I mistreated you without being aware of the things I've said. I also apologize for the passive-aggressive approach whenever somethings bugging me, especially when I'm in the wrong. I can't help but say this but can we please fix this? I want to make bawi for the things that I've done.       

        I know you're a high maintenanced girly that's why you deserve everything in this world. I've always said that I want to be better, but this time I'm gonna do it right. I'll show it to you that these are not merely words so please. From the bottom of my heart, Im really sorry:((</p>
